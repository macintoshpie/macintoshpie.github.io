# linoleum

=> /sometimes-i-write
* .. I wanted to make some prints on hats for a "running party" we were having. A mouse dubbed [Mr. Jiggy](https://banjokazooie.fandom.com/wiki/Jiggy) lives (lived) with us, so I wanted him as a mascot on each teams hat. So I bought some linoleum, cheap ass tools, and speedball fabric ink off amazon.
* .. I found a chinese site that sells hat blanks, but I would not recommend it because the hats I received did not look like the advertised product. 1 star.

> mr. jiggy lived in our dishwasher and while playing banjo kazooie after my roommate had a heatstroke we though it was really funny to name him that (her? we don't know).
* .. I asked Dall-E to generate some photos of linoleum mice as a starting place then handdrew a simplified version onto the linoleum.
* .. This worked out pretty well other than the fact that I probably made it slightly too small (~2x2 inches) and it was really hard to get the hair detail. Not much to say about the cutting.

* .. I of course forgot that the print would be "in reverse" (flipped on horizontally) but who cares when it's a mouse. It would have been a problem if I stuck with the original plan of writing "stay sweaty" in Bosnian underneath but I scrapped that after our Bosnian friend began to explain the fact that Bosnian has gendered nouns and I didn't like the longer alternatives.
* .. Though I just did some googling/llming and found some cool bosnian bro speak like "Å¾iva legenda" (living legend) which would have been dope.

> chatgpt tells me "ajmo brate" says "lets go bro" and I found this shirt on amazon (supposedly) saying "let's go bro, sit in the tavern, order, drink, and eat, let the eyes shine from the wine, we don't live for a thousand years" which is a sentiment I appreciate
* .. I rolled the ink on 4th of july paper plates that were too small. I will be looking for glass panes or something similar for rolling ink at the animal crossing store in future visits.
* .. I learned that I have no idea how much ink to use, and that you should put a solid thing behind whatever you're printing on (the mesh backing left a pattern in the first print). But it does seem cool to experiment printing with some patterned texture behind the print.
* .. I had been warned that nylon is a terrible fabric to print on but I did it anyways.
* .. It's still not fully dry after 12 hours but whatever. we'll see. it'll probably wash out.
* .. The first few hats looked ok. In future prints I'd like to try a few things:
* .... simpler design
* .... bigger design (~2.5 inches)
* .... trim off more of the excess linoleum when working with awkward printing surfaces

> the white print had way too much ink I think. The black print looks wonky because I printed without a solid surface behind the fabric (the mesh behind the hat came through).
